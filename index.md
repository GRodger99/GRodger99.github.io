## This is My Portfolio

Below you will find some of the projects that I am proud to have worked on!

### Honours Project

My Honours Project was a retrofitted bullet-hell game that was made to sync gameplay to the user's choice of music.

If you would like to try this out for yourself (I would suggest you do as it can be really cool!), you can find a working version of this project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18sdUkHjLTAIPIne3IwIdoNyQPl4VYGkK/view?usp=sharing)


### Professional Project

During my Third year of university i was tasked to work with a group to create a game based on a brief provided to us by The Chinese Room. Througout the production of the project I primarily worked on implementing the audio solution through Wwise into Unreal Engine 4, while also working on some gameplay elements and implementing the animations.
