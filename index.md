## This is my Portfolio

### Honours Project

My Honours Project was a retrofitted game that was made to sync gameplay to the user's choice of music

### Professional Project

During my Third year of university i was tasked to work with a group to create a game based on a brief provided to us by The Chinese Room. During this project I primarily worked on implementing the audio solution through wWise into Unreal Engine 4, while also working partly on gameplay and implementing the animations.
