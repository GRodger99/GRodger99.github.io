                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Game Audio Programmer with 3 years of experiance working on AAA game audio within Unreal Engine. <br>

                    Originally I started off as a Generalist Games Programmer, I have transitioned over to audio due to my keen interest and enjoyment of Game Audio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an avid gamer with my favourite genres usually being FPS, RTS and MMORPG, while also having played many other genres and enjoyed what they had to offer. <br>
                    I am also a very musical person having achieved grade 8 Clarinet and participated in many concert bands and orchestras. <br>
                    In my free time I am enjoying challenging myself by learning Korean as a second language.

                <h2>Hoard Hunter (GMTK-2024 Game Jam)</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2024 with some Colleagues from Splash, I participated in the GMTK GameJam with the theme of "Built To Scale". <br>
                    The game is unfinished (Such be the nature of a gamejam and last minute team forming) but revolves around taking treasure from the dragons den without waking it up!  <br><br>
                    I implemented a simple State based Music system that reacts to when the dragon wakes up, and added some quick library sounds I found online for gameplay (I'm no designer! But I'll implement them!).<br>
                    Alongside this I scaled the volume of the dragon sleeping and some rumbling thresholds to help alert the player to a rising "Awakeness" of the dragon.<br>
                    This was actually my first game Jam and I had a genuine blast, please take a look if you have some time!

                <p>My honours project was a retrofitted bullet-hell game that was made to sync some gameplay elements to the user's choice of music. Here I created a host application for Vamp Plugins and used the values returned within an open source game.</p>
                <p>If you would like to try this out for yourself (I would suggest you do as it can be really cool!), you can find a working version of this project in the link below! </p>

                <p>During my Third year of university I was tasked to work with a group to create a game based on a brief provided to us by The Chinese Room. Throughout the production of the project I primarily worked on implementing the audio solution through Wwise into Unreal Engine 4, while also working on some gameplay elements and implementing the animations.</p>
