							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p>I am a soon-to-be Bsc (Hons) graduate from the University of Abertay Dundee after studying Computer Games Technology. </p>
<p>
I am an avid gamer with my favourite genres usually being FPS, RTS and MMORPG, while also having played many other genres and enjoyed what they had to offer. I am also a very musical person having achieved grade 8 Clarinet and participated in many concert bands and orchestras</p>

<p>	I would like to apply my skills and enthusiasm to a Graduate programming role, specifically to a role in Gameplay or Audio Programming.</p>

							<h2>Honours Project</h2>
							<p>My honours project was a retrofitted bullet-hell game that was made to sync some gameplay elements to the user's choice of music. Here I created a host application for Vamp Plugins and used the values returned within an open source game.</p>
								<p>If you would like to try this out for yourself (I would suggest you do as it can be really cool!), you can find a working version of this project in the link below! </p>

							<h2>Professional Project</h2>
							<p>During my Third year of university I was tasked to work with a group to create a game based on a brief provided to us by The Chinese Room. Throughout the production of the project I primarily worked on implementing the audio solution through Wwise into Unreal Engine 4, while also working on some gameplay elements and implementing the animations.</p>
